            "Charles “Corky” Bell has been serving generations of hungry North Floridians perfectly delectable crispy fried, broiled, blackened, or grilled fish and shellfish since he opened his first restaurant at Pacetti’s on the Trout Creek in 1979. Since opening Corky Bell’s in Palatka with his wife Betty, he has created an array of specialty dishes from Garlic Shrimp Scampi, Creamy Seafood Alfredo’s, Corky’s Stuffed Fish and Swamp Treats like Gator Tail and Frog legs.  Now Corky Bell’s is located at beautiful Gator Landing located on the St. John’s River where Corky’s high standards of quality food and excellent service will continue to impress each guest that walks through the door. The history of this well known Palatka landmark will continue to be shared.  Gator Landing is located on a part of the St. John’s River known as “The Devil’s Elbow” and from 1938 until 1995 a marine repair and supply yard owned and operated by Frank Oliver occupied this site. Recognizing the beauty and uniqueness of this location, Oliver built a restaurant for others to enjoy the unobstructed view of the “Elbow”. Guests can now keep this tradition alive with Corky Bell and his dedicated crew.  “I am committed to serving the best and sincerely want you to enjoy your dining experience with us!” Corky signature"
